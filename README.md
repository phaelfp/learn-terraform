# Learning Terraform

This project was used as a Terraform study using as a basis the documentation available at the URL https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/docker-get-started/docker-build accessed on 05/09/2024

The first provider studied was Docker because it is more practical, without having to have any cloud account (AWS, GGloud, Digital Ocean, etc.)

## Docker Provider
 - [Build infrastructure](Docker/step1.md)
 - [Change infrastructure](Docker/step2.md)
 - [Destroy infrastructure](Docker/step3.md)
 - [Define input variables](Docker/step4.md)
 - [Query data with outputs](Docker/step5.md)
